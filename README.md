# Moderate Resolution Burned Area Estimation
The repository provides code resources to estimate burned area based on a combination of VIIRS Active Fire Detections (AFDs), acquired from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), part of NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), and Landsat 7 &amp; 8 atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data made available through the US Geological Survey (USGS), and accessible through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform.
